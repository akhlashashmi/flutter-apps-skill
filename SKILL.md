## Architecture

Use a feature-first MVVM structure. Organize code by feature first, then split each feature into `data`, `domain`, `repositories`, and `presentation`.

Treat `presentation/` as the MVVM layer:
- Screens and widgets are the View.
- Riverpod notifiers are the ViewModel.
- `domain/` holds pure business entities.
- `data/` holds models and data sources.
- `repositories/` orchestrate reads, writes, mapping, and caching for the feature.

```text
lib/
|-- core/           # Shared code: theme, utils, widgets, navigation, services
|-- features/       # Feature modules (auth, products, home, ...)
|   `-- feature_x/
|       |-- data/           # Models and data sources (API/local)
|       |-- domain/         # Pure Dart entities with no framework dependencies
|       |-- repositories/   # Coordinate data sources and map models to entities
|       `-- presentation/   # Notifiers, screens, and widgets
`-- main.dart
```

Keep each layer focused on one responsibility. Domain defines entities. Data handles models and data sources. Repositories coordinate feature data flow. Presentation manages UI state and user interaction through MVVM-style notifiers.

## Critical Rules

1. **Use code generation only**. Prefer `@riverpod` or `@Riverpod(keepAlive: true)`. Do not use `StateProvider`, `StateNotifierProvider`, or `ChangeNotifierProvider`.
2. **Use sealed classes with Freezed**. Declare Freezed types as `sealed class`, not `abstract class`.
3. **Avoid prop drilling**. Let child widgets watch providers directly instead of receiving provider state through constructors.
4. **Guard async work**. After every `await` in a notifier, check `if (!ref.mounted) return;`.
5. **Use a single `Ref` type**. Riverpod 3.x uses `Ref`. Do not use `AutoDisposeRef`, `FutureProviderRef`, or generated ref subtypes.
6. **Rely on equality filtering**. Providers already use `==` to filter updates. Override `updateShouldNotify` only when necessary.
7. **Use `select` in leaf widgets**. Prefer `ref.watch(provider.select((s) => s.field))` when a widget needs only one field.
8. **Keep one class per file**. Each entity, model, notifier, screen, and widget should live in its own file.
9. **Stay feature-first**. Do not move feature-specific code into app-wide type folders.
10. **Keep MVVM boundaries clear**. Put UI logic in widgets and Riverpod notifiers, not in repositories or datasources.

## Provider Decision Tree

```text
Is it a repository, datasource, or service?
  -> Use @Riverpod(keepAlive: true) so it stays alive

Is it a feature notifier that manages mutable state?
  -> Use @Riverpod(keepAlive: true) class FeatureNotifier extends _$FeatureNotifier

Is it a computed value or one-time fetch?
  -> Use @riverpod so it auto-disposes when unused

Does it need parameters?
  -> Add parameters to the generated function and let codegen create the family
```

## Freezed Patterns

```dart
// Simple data class
@freezed
sealed class Product with _$Product {
  const Product._(); // Required when adding methods or getters

  const factory Product({
    required String id,
    required String name,
    @Default(0) int quantity,
  }) = _Product;

  factory Product.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$ProductFromJson(json);

  // Keep domain behavior on the model itself.
  bool get inStock => quantity > 0;
}

// Union type with exhaustive pattern matching
@freezed
sealed class AuthState with _$AuthState {
  const factory AuthState.authenticated(User user) = Authenticated;
  const factory AuthState.unauthenticated() = Unauthenticated;
  const factory AuthState.loading() = AuthLoading;
}
```

## Notifier Pattern

```dart
@Riverpod(keepAlive: true)
class ProductNotifier extends _$ProductNotifier {
  @override
  ProductState build() {
    _load();
    return const ProductState();
  }

  Future<void> _load() async {
    state = state.copyWith(isLoading: true);
    try {
      final items = await ref.read(productRepositoryProvider).fetchAll();
      if (!ref.mounted) return;
      state = state.copyWith(items: items, isLoading: false);
    } catch (e) {
      if (!ref.mounted) return;
      state = state.copyWith(isLoading: false, error: e.toString());
    }
  }
}
```

## Code Generation

```bash
# Watch mode (recommended during development)
dart run build_runner watch -d

# One-time build
dart run build_runner build -d

# Clean build to resolve conflicts
dart run build_runner clean && dart run build_runner build -d
```

## Quick Imports

```dart
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';
import 'package:riverpod_annotation/riverpod_annotation.dart';
import 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';
import 'package:go_router/go_router.dart';
import 'package:my_app/core/extensions/extensions.dart'; // Context, string, and date extensions

// In route files
part 'routes.g.dart';
```

## Anti-Patterns

| Avoid | Prefer | Why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| `StateProvider` | `@riverpod` code generation | `StateProvider` is legacy and moved to `legacy.dart` |
| `abstract class` with Freezed | `sealed class` | Enables exhaustive pattern matching |
| Parent watches and passes state to child | Child watches directly | Avoids prop drilling |
| Missing `ref.mounted` check | `if (!ref.mounted) return;` | Prevents updates after disposal |
| `ref.read` in `initState` | `addPostFrameCallback` and then read | Ensures the provider is ready |
| `AutoDisposeNotifier` | `Notifier` in Riverpod 3.x | Old duplication was removed |
| `ExampleRef ref` in generated code | `Ref ref` | Ref subclasses were removed |
| `try-catch` in every layer | Catch once in the notifier | Avoids repetitive rethrows |
| `context.go('/path')` string routes | `const MyRoute().go(context)` | Gives compile-time safety |
| `context.go()` between peer routes just to update the URL | `GoRouter.optionURLReflectsImperativeAPIs = true` with `push`/`pop` | Preserves directional animation while still updating the browser URL |
| Redirect every `loading` state to splash | Return `null` during loading for non-setup pages | Prevents losing the current web URL during refresh |
| Depend only on GoRouter redirect after login | Add `ref.listen(authProvider)` in auth pages as a fallback | Redirect timing can be unreliable |
| Use auth-level `isLoading` during OAuth | Use per-button loading such as `isGoogleLoading` | Prevents premature splash redirects |
| `ref.watch()` inside GoRouter redirect | `ref.listen()` plus `refreshListenable`, then `ref.read()` in redirect | Prevents router recreation and stack resets |
| Full re-fetch on every sync | `mergeAll` plus ID diff with `deleteByIds` | Reduces work from all records to changed records only |
| `Theme.of(context).colorScheme` | `context.colors` | Keeps color access consistent through extensions |
| `ScaffoldMessenger.of(context)` | `SnackBarUtils.showSuccess()` | Centralizes feedback and avoids context plumbing |
| Anemic model with mapping logic elsewhere | Rich model with methods on the model | Keeps behavior close to data |
| Missing `@JsonSerializable(explicitToJson: true)` on nested Freezed models | Add it on the factory constructor | Prevents release crashes such as `_XYZ is not a subtype of Map` |
